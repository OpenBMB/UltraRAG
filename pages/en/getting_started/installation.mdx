UR-2.0 provides a user-friendly installation process, allowing you to set up the base environment with just a few commands. It also supports a modular dependency system that enables flexible extension of components while avoiding unnecessary installations.

## Step 1: Preparation

Create a virtual environment using Conda:

```shell
conda create -n ultrarag python=3.11
conda activate ultrarag
```

<Tip>Donâ€™t have Conda? Visit [Install Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install).</Tip>

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for package management, which provides a faster and more reliable Python dependency management experience:

```shell
pip install uv
```

## Step 2: Install the Basic Environment

<Note>PyPI and Conda releases will be supported gradually.</Note>

Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine or server:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git
cd UltraRAG
```

Install the base dependencies using Conda and uv:

```shell
uv pip install -e .
```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Run the following command to test whether the installation was successful:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/sayhello.yaml
```

If everything is configured correctly, the terminal will display a welcome message:

## Step 4: Install Optional Components

UR-2.0 supports a wide range of server components. Developers can flexibly install additional dependencies as needed for their specific tasks:

```shell
# To use faiss for vector indexing:
# Depending on your hardware environment, compile and install the appropriate FAISS version manually.
# Install faiss-cpu
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu
# Install faiss-gpu
conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu

# To use infinity_emb for corpus encoding and indexing:
uv pip install -e ".[infinity_emb]"

# To use the lancedb vector database:
uv pip install -e ".[lancedb]"

# To deploy models using vLLM:
uv pip install -e ".[vllm]"

# To enable corpus document parsing:
uv pip install -e ".[corpus]"

# To install all dependencies (excluding FAISS):
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```
