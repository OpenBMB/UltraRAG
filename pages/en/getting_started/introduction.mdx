## UltraRAG 2.0

**UltraRAG 2.0 (UR-2.0)** is the first lightweight framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on the [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) architecture. It is designed to provide efficient modeling support for scientific research and exploration. UR-2.0 standardizes core RAG components—such as [**Retriever**](/pages/en/rag_servers/retriever) and [**Generation**](/pages/en/rag_servers/generation)—into independent MCP Servers, and enables flexible integration and extension through function-level **Tool** interfaces. With the MCP Client serving as a process scheduler, developers can build complex reasoning pipelines featuring **sequential**, **loop**, and **conditional branching** structures simply by writing concise **YAML** files. This approach significantly lowers the technical barriers and learning curve for developing and debugging sophisticated RAG systems.

  <Card title="📑 Pipeline">
    A YAML-based process definition file used to describe the execution order and logic of component and tool calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🕹️ Client">
    The central controller of the workflow that parses the Pipeline and coordinates the execution order of Tools across different Servers.

  <Card title="🔧 Server">
    A collection of independently callable functional modules. Developers can easily add new features or modules via standardized interfaces for flexible extension and efficient composition.

In addition, UR-2.0 provides step-by-step tutorials, integrates multiple mainstream benchmark tasks and high-quality baselines, and offers a unified evaluation system and knowledge base to greatly improve development efficiency and ensure experimental reproducibility.

## Why UltraRAG 2.0?

RAG systems are evolving from simple, modular pipelines into complex architectures that rely on **model-driven reasoning**, **dynamic retrieval**, and **conditional decision-making**. Traditional frameworks often lack the flexibility and scalability required for multi-turn interactions and adaptive information updates. Furthermore, existing open-source implementations typically lack a unified paradigm, leading to tightly coupled and inconsistent baseline modules that hinder understanding, reproducibility, and comparative research.

To address these challenges, **UltraRAG 2.0** is designed to offer:

<Card title="🚀 Low-code construction of complex pipelines">
  Natively supports sequential, looping, and conditional reasoning structures. Developers can implement iterative RAG workflows by writing simple YAML files with just a few dozen lines of code.
</Card>

<Card title="⚡ Rapid reproduction and extensibility">
  Built on the MCP architecture, all modules are encapsulated as independent and reusable Servers. Each function is registered as a Tool, allowing new functionalities to be seamlessly integrated into the overall pipeline with minimal effort.
</Card>

<Card title="📊 Unified evaluation and benchmarking">
  Provides standardized evaluation workflows and metric management, supports multiple mainstream [**Benchmark**](/pages/en/develop_guide/dataset) datasets out of the box, and continuously integrates new baselines to enhance research reproducibility and optimization efficiency.
