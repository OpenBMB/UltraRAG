During experiments, it is often necessary to run multiple trials of the same Pipeline with different hyperparameter configurations, either in parallel or in batches.  
UltraRAG provides a flexible parameter file mechanism that allows quick switching between configurations **without modifying the main Pipeline**.

## Step 1: Build the Pipeline

As in the standard workflow, first compile the Pipeline:

```shell
ultrarag build examples/rag_full.yaml
```

## Step 2: Run

After modifying the relevant fields in the generated parameter file, execute the following command to run the experiment:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/rag_full.yaml
```

## Step 3: Create a New Parameter File

If you want to test different parameter combinations on the same Pipeline, simply create a new parameter file,  
for example: `examples/parameter/rag_full_parameter_new.yaml` (you may choose any name).

Then, when running the command, specify the parameter file using the `--param` option:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/rag_full.yaml --param examples/parameter/rag_full_parameter_new.yaml
```

This way, the system will execute the same Pipeline using the new parameter configuration,  
making it easy to conduct multiple experiments in parallel or perform batch comparisons efficiently.
