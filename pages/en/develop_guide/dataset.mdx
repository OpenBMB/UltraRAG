We have curated and preprocessed the most commonly used public benchmark datasets and corpora in current RAG research.  
All datasets have been released on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/UltraRAG/UltraRAG_Benchmark) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UltraRAG/UltraRAG_Benchmark).  
Users can directly download and use them without additional cleaning or conversion — they are fully compatible with UltraRAG’s evaluation pipelines.

**Data Format Specification**

To ensure full compatibility with UltraRAG modules, users are advised to store test data uniformly in `.jsonl` format following the specifications below.

Non-multiple-choice data format:

```json icon="/images/json.svg"
{
  "id": 0, 
  "question": "where does the karate kid 2010 take place", 
  "golden_answers": ["China", "Beijing", "Beijing, China"], 
  "meta_data": {} 
}
```

Multiple-choice data format:

```json icon="/images/json.svg"
{
  "id": 0, 
  "question": "Mast Co. converted from the FIFO method for inventory valuation to the LIFO method for financial statement and tax purposes. During a period of inflation would Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO? Ending inventory Income tax payable", 
  "golden_answers": ["A"], 
  "choices": ["Lower Lower", "Higher Higher", "Lower Higher", "Higher Lower"], 
  "meta_data": {"subject": "professional_accounting"}
}
```

**Data Format Specification**

Text corpus format:

```json icon="/images/json.svg"
{
  "id": "15106858", 
  "contents": "Arrowhead Stadium 1970s practice would eventually spread to the other NFL stadiums as the 1970s progressed, finally becoming mandatory league-wide in the 1978 season (after being used in Super Bowl XII), and become almost near-universal at the lower levels of football. On January 20, 1974, Arrowhead Stadium hosted the Pro Bowl. Due to an ice storm and brutally cold temperatures the week leading up to the game, the game's participants worked out at the facilities of the San Diego Chargers. On game day, the temperature soared to 41 F, melting most of the ice and snow that accumulated during the week. The AFC defeated the NFC, 15–13."
