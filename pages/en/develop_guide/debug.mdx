To develop and debug UltraRAG more efficiently, you can use **VSCode’s built-in debugging tools** to run a specified Pipeline configuration file and set breakpoints during execution.

## Step 1: Compile and Configure Parameters

Using `examples/rag_full.yaml` as an example, first compile the Pipeline and complete the parameter configuration.  
This process is identical to the one described in [Quick Start](/pages/en/getting_started/quick_start), except that **you do not need to execute the run command** in this case.

## Step 2: Create a Debug Configuration File

Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file in the project root directory and add the following content:

```json .vscode/launch.json icon="/images/json.svg" highlight="11"
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "UltraRAG Debug",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/ultrarag/client.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "${workspaceFolder}/examples/rag_full.yaml" 
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        }
    ]
}
```

<Note>If you want to debug a different Pipeline, simply replace the path in `args` with the corresponding YAML file path.</Note>

## Step 3: Start Debugging

1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel on the left sidebar of VSCode (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+D`).  
2. In the debug configuration dropdown, select **UltraRAG Debug**.  
3. Click the green ▶ **Start Debugging** button to run and debug the program directly in the integrated terminal of VSCode.

You can set breakpoints in any Python file to observe the execution flow and inspect variable states step by step.
