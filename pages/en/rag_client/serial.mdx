The **sequential structure** is the most fundamental and commonly used execution pattern in a Pipeline.  
Multiple steps are executed in order, where the output of one step (if any) can serve as the input to the next, or each step can run independently.  
A standard RAG workflow can typically be constructed using only the sequential structure, allowing smooth execution from data loading to final evaluation.

## Usage Example

```yaml examples/rag.yaml icon="/images/yaml.svg"
# MCP Server
servers:
  benchmark: servers/benchmark
  retriever: servers/retriever
  prompt: servers/prompt
  generation: servers/generation
  evaluation: servers/evaluation
  custom: servers/custom

# MCP Client Pipeline
pipeline:
- benchmark.get_data
- retriever.retriever_init
- retriever.retriever_search
- generation.generation_init
- prompt.qa_rag_boxed
- generation.generate
- custom.output_extract_from_boxed
- evaluation.evaluate
```

In a sequential structure, each line in the Pipeline represents a call to a specific Tool.  
The basic syntax is as follows:

```yaml
- server_name.tool_name
```

- `server_name`: The name of the module being invoked. It must be declared in the `servers` section in advance.  
- `tool_name`: The name of the function registered within that module using the `@tool(...)` or `@prompt(...)` decorator.

This structure is suitable for most single-turn question-answering or reasoning tasks and serves as the foundation for understanding more complex structures such as loops and branches.
